# austinux.org

This is the public repository for the AustinUX.org web site, which lists UX- and design-related resources in Austin, TX, since 2010.

As of July 28, 2016, the `austinux.org` site is built using [Grow](https://grow.io), a static site generator written in Python and backed by Git, which isn't important unless you want to contribute entirely new types of content.

## Contributing

Have you found a new meetup or other local Austin resource you think should be added to the site?  Has a meetup in the list not met in the past year?  Let me know!  You can either:

- [Add a new "issue" with all the details](https://github.com/vitorio/austinux.org/issues/new) (easy!), or
- Fork the repository, edit `content/pages/home.md` directly, and file a pull request (hard!)

Some suggestions:

- Meetups should have met in the past year.
- Online groups should have a local Austin presence (e.g. the global Designer Hangout chat has a #local_austin channel, and so it is listed; but the Practical Service Design Slack does not, and so it is not).
