üìï Then-UXPA president Cory Lebson wrote a nice article about Austin UX for UX Magazine, [The Hidden Value of UX Connectors and the Future of Our Community](http://uxmag.com/articles/the-hidden-value-of-ux-connectors-and-the-future-of-our-community).

üìô The story of Austin UX, some history of the Austin design community, and a call to design better meetups, can be found in the essay [Local Communities In Practice and By Design](http://vitor.io/local-communities-in-practice-and-by-design).

üèõ One of the groups studied in that essay, IxDA Austin, ran from March 2009 to August 2018.  If you're looking for a classic event, the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180729112933/http://ixdaaustin.ning.com/) should have captures of all that historic design community content, and I have a WARC if anyone is looking to do analysis.  Get in touch!
